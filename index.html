        <h1>What's a "detached HEAD" in Git?</h1>
<p>It might very well be that you'll never come across this "mysterious" state in your Git career. However, if you do one day, you'd probably like to know what a "detached HEAD" is - and how you might have arrived at that state.</p>
<h3 id="chapter_understanding+how+%22checkout%22+works">Understanding how "checkout" works</h3>
<p>With the "<strong>git checkout</strong>" command, you determine which revision of your project you want to work on. Git then places all of that revision's files in your working copy folder.</p>
<p>Normally, you use a <em>branch name</em> to communicate with "git checkout":</p>
<pre><code><span class="cli-prompt">$ git checkout development</span>
</code></pre>
<p>However, you <em>can</em> also provide the <em>SHA1 hash</em> of a specific commit instead:</p>
<pre><code><span class="cli-prompt">$ git checkout 56a4e5c08</span>
Note: checking out '56a4e5c08'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state...
</code></pre>
<p>This exact state - when a specific <em>commit</em> is checked out instead of a <em>branch</em> - is what's called a "detached HEAD".</p>

<h3 id="chapter_the+problem+with+a+detached+head">The problem with a detached HEAD</h3>
<p>The HEAD pointer in Git determines your current working revision (and thereby the files that are placed in your project's working directory). Normally, when checking out a proper branch name, Git automatically moves the HEAD pointer along when you create a new commit. You are automatically on the newest commit of the chosen branch.</p>
<p>When you instead choose to check out a <em>commit hash</em>, Git won't do this for you. The consequence is that when you make changes and commit them, these <strong>changes do NOT belong to any branch</strong>.<br>
This means they can easily get lost once you check out a different revision or branch: not being recorded in the context of a branch, you lack the possibility to access that state easily (unless you have a brilliant memory and can remember the commit hash of that new commit...).</p>

<h3 id="chapter_when+a+detached+head+shows+up">When a detached HEAD shows up</h3>
<p>There are a handful of situations where detached HEAD states are common:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/advanced-topics/submodules#start">Submodules</a> are indeed checked out at specific commits instead of branches.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/advanced-topics/rebase#start">Rebase</a> works by creating a <em>temporary</em> detached HEAD state while it runs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chapter_where+a+detached+head+should+%3Cstrong%3Enot%3C%2Fstrong%3E+show+up">Where a detached HEAD should <strong>not</strong> show up</h3>
<p>Additionally, another situation might spring to mind: what about going back in time to try out an older version of your project? For example in the context of a bug, you want to see how things worked in an older revision.</p>
<p>This is a perfectly valid and common use case. However, you don't have to maneuver yourself into a detached HEAD state to deal with it. Instead, remember how simple and cheap the whole concept of branching is in Git: you can simply create a (temporary) branch and delete it once you're done.</p>
<pre><code><span class="cli-prompt">$ git checkout -b test-branch 56a4e5c08</span>

...do your thing...

$ git checkout master
$ git branch -d test-branch
</code></pre>
